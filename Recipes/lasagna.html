        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            Lasagna, a culinary masterpiece, is a layered Italian dish that seamlessly combines a symphony of flavors and textures into a comforting and hearty ensemble.
            At its core, lasagna is a meticulous assembly of ingredients, featuring sheets of pasta generously layered with rich Bolognese or marinara sauce, velvety béchamel,
            and a medley of cheeses, typically mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan.The pasta sheets, often pre-cooked to al dente perfection, absorb the savory essence of the sauces, creating a harmonious marriage of taste.
            As the lasagna bakes, the cheeses melt into a golden crust, while the layers meld into a decadent, sliceable delight. Whether crafted with classic meat fillings or inventive vegetarian alternatives,
            lasagna is more than a dish—it is a culinary journey, a communal experience that transcends generations, gracing tables with its aromatic presence and offering a slice of indulgence with every forkful.

            <h1>Steps</h1>
               <ol>
                <li>Preheat the Oven:
                    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Boil the Noodles:
                    Boil the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente.
                    Drain and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Bolognese Sauce:
                        In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.
                        Sauté finely chopped onions and minced garlic until translucent.
                        Add ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in tomato paste, then add crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper.
                        Simmer the sauce, allowing it to thicken.</li>
                        <li>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture:
                            In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, a beaten egg, chopped fresh basil, and grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
                            <li>Assemble the Layers:
                                In a baking dish, start with a layer of Bolognese sauce, followed by a layer of lasagna noodles.
                                Spread a portion of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese.
                                Repeat the layers, finishing with a generous topping of mozzarella cheese.</li>
                                <li>Bake:
                                    Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.
                                    Then, uncover and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
                                    <li>Rest Before Serving:
                                        Allow the lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.
                                        This helps the layers set, making it easier to cut and serve.</li>
                                        <li>Serve:
                                            Cut into portions and serve the delicious, homemade classic beef lasagna.</li>
